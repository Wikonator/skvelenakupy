Hi!

This repo is a showcase of my code for the e-commerce website Deborahmilano.sk that I've done as a final project for my
bootcamp at SPICED Berlin.

I'm using Node with Express running the server, handlebars as a template engine and Mongo as my main database

I've decided I don't want to use an MVC framework such as Angular, as I've worked with those in other places (and I wanted a little challenge)

Feel free to look around!
